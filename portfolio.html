      <h3><i>Landscape Loss</i>, Digital Image, 2018</h3>
      <p>This is a glitched digital image. I began with an original digital jpeg file, which was an image of the ocean at sunset. This was a photo I took from the coast in Northern California during the wildfires of 2017. The sunset was incredibly vivid and striking, both in person, and in the photo. This intensity was due to the amount of air pollution in the sky. I decided to intentionally remove data, and explore the concept of loss in the image, through a glitching process using Audacity sound editing software.</p>

        <h3><i>Dystopian Holiday</i>, Digital Image, 2018</h3>
        <p> This is a digital composite image using a screen capture of the Grand Canyon from Google Maps and found images. This new landscape image is an exploration of our evolving relationship to the environment and how many locations are increasingly vulnerable to hyper tourism, eroded protections, and pollution. I composited pool toys and yoga balls over this remote landmark and digitally altered the color and resolution to create a hyper-real experience.</p>

       <h3><i>Signal</i>, Digital Sound, 3:07, 2018</h3>
       <p>This piece combines my own field recordings of coyotes and a power plant with a found sound of crickets. I created a composite of these three different forms of audio signals in order to create a new signal. The image above represents the installation environment in which this sound would ideally be experienced- in a gallery space with a single satellite dish form in the center of the gallery.</p>

     <h3><i>The Ocean</i>, Digital Video, 5:21, 2018</h3>
     <p>This digital video combines my own recorded footage from a whale watching trip with found footage of a historic whaling trip. I created a single channel video showing these three perspectives of the ocean and our evolving relationship to it.</p>

     <h3><i>Open the CD-Rom</i>, Interactive Net Art, 2018</h3>
     <p>This interactive net art piece is based on one of my earliest memories using a computer. I created an interpreted interactive experience based on this memory, which includes images, videos, and sounds related to Arizona, where the memory was experienced.</p>

     <h3><i>Cyborg Life</i>, Interactive Net Art using p5.js, 2018</h3>
     <p>This is a net art piece which uses the p5.js programming language to create an interactive cyber landscape. In this work I was considering how much time I (and many people) spend on the computer. It's an amazing tool. However, I often feel disconnected from the physical world when I am very immersed in digital projects. I think of this experience as a form of cyborg life.</p>
