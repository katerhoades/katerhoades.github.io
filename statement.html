  <p><b>Your artist statement is a chance to tell the reader what you do and why you do it.</b><br>
<br>
  <b>First Paragraph</b><br>Identify the medium or mediums you work in and what process you use. Identify your reason for making work and for using the materials that you use. Also address other issues that are important (why do you do what you do? how does it connect to the world?)<br><br>

  <b>Second Paragraph</b><br>Expand on the first paragraph and describes more of your process, or a specific project and how it is an example of your overall way of working. Make connections for your reader by connecting how you use your materials to why you are making work.
